# GoCommerce

GoCommerce is an open source and complete ECommerce API, written entirely in Go.

### Features

Okay, so some of these aren't technically implemented yet but they *will* be features!

- Users
- Products
- Product Variations (color, size, etc)
- Orders
- Cart
- Auth (w/ multiple providers)
- Stripe

This is a WIP.
